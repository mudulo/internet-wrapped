## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Browser History Limitations

Due to browser-specific restrictions:
- **Chrome-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave): History access is limited to approximately the last 90 days
- **Firefox**: There is no time limit, but there is a number of entries limit, so the entire year may not be covered
- **Safari**: Not supported due to history API limitations for extensions

These limitations are set by the browsers themselves and cannot be bypassed. The extension will work with whatever history data is available.
